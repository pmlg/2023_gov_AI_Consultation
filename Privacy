Privacy: the slippery slope,

Without privacy we seem to inevitably end up treading the same path
observing activity -> profiling -> tracking -> manipulation -> control

Correlating observable activity to create personally identifiable profiles is a grey area
Trading of personally identifiable profiles without known end use is problematic
Organization are benefitting from exploiting lax privacy in way which are negatively impacting peoples quality of life?
